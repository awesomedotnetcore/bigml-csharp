Perhaps if the playing field were leveled. And not matter how rich or poor you are, no matter if you live in NYC or in a remote backwater village, the playing field is not level.   This visualization is wonderful because it is stunningly effectively at highlighting income disparity. Think about it, even the top baseball salary is so close to the $0 mark. Let it sink in where everyone else is.  You, me, the radio host, the person at McDonalds, your boss, the supermarket clerk.  At the very minimum I hope this leads to two thoughts in your mind:   1. We have to absolutely do something about leveling the playing field. Subsidies for the richest farmers or Chevron or WalMart or tax loop holes for individuals or industries or political patronage that leads to awful contracts for public works project or unions etc. etc. must be looked at carefully.   There should be ZERO doubt that the playing field as to be leveled so that we can all be the best we can be.  2. If you are reading this, you are likely at the top of the 99%. Think about it. The top. So. If it is within your capacity to do something for the bottom 99%, please consider doing so. Volunteer work, political protest, represent their voice, anything helps.

This should not happen, people of Ukraine should decide their own destiny. Put that aside for a second, just think of why Ukraine is in the challenging situation it is in. There are two problems not getting enough attention.  Both the Government that was just kicked out and the one (opposition) before that was defeated in a proper election were hugely corrupt. Citizens suffered under both. The country had devastating consequences from this selfishness.   Regardless of what happens (let's hope Mr. Putin comes to his senses), I think we are all under-estimating how difficult this problem will be to root out (also because we are not thinking about it).  Second is the lovely visualization below. For xyz reasons Ukraine's economy has lagged behind (understatement) what others have managed to do. Revolution or no revolution, this is a massive problem that needs to be solved.   Because it will take a very long time and a lot of pain to solve, it puts the outcome of the current round of the revolution in jeopardy.   Even if Mr. Putin leaves, and then leaves Ukraine alone, this nice country is in for an incredible challenge. The common woman/man in Ukraine is in for a long (perhaps multi-generational) road.   We (all lovers of Ukraine) should commit to Ukraine for the long, long term, and I hope Ukraine's politicians will make strong long term friends because if these friends leave after the latest round of stress things will be even worse.

These states also enjoyed the positive outcomes of such behaviors, including lower obesity rates and other common health problems.  This is West Virginia's 5th consecutive appearance at #50.

I believe the headline is wrong. (Would not be the first time ! :)).<br /><br />All of America is not on Twitter. In fact I would argue that a surprising percentage of America does not even know what Twitter is. But everyone has TV. Yes, sadly everyone.<br /><br />So anyone trying to make a case that Twitter represents TV tastes or TV anything is being silly (including, if this is the case, Twitter).  If they also believe that &quot;brand engagement on Twitter&quot; will drive overall TV show watching (or store sales or software downloads by <b>everyone</b>) then they are being silly squared.<br /><br />A percentage of America is on Twitter (Me! <a href=""http://goo.gl/tihSfi"" class=""ot-anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/tihSfi</a>). Of that percentage, a certain smaller percentage talks about TV shows they are watching on twitter.  Of that smaller percentage a smaller still percentage has Followers who start conversations about those TV shows. Of that smaller still percentage some tiny percentage will be influenced to watch the TV show because they have never watched it before. This will boost ratings.<br /><br />So. Be on Twitter. I cannot mean that more. Understand who is there. If your TV shows are being discussed, participate in the conversation. Expect a small boost. <br /><br />But to think Twitter (or Facebook or Google+) represent America is stilly. To think that you can take your &quot;lame top ranked NCIS&quot; and &quot;make people talk about it on Twitter&quot; is silly. It won&#39;t. Because Twitter, see a pattern here, does not represent America.<br /><br />A great product sometimes creates great social conversation. If you see that conversation, participate and encourage.

The graph is for elective surgery.<br /><br />Sixty percent of all cosmetic plastic surgery in the US comprises four procedures: breast augmentation, nose reshaping, eyelid surgery, and liposuction. Breast augmentation accounts for the plurality of all cosmetic surgeries in the US at 18.4%.<br /><br />Overall, 87% of all elective cosmetic surgeries were performed on females. (In one sense this is not surprising, yet 87% seems high. No?)<br /><br />For women, the five most common were the four listed above plus facelifts. Among men, the most common procedures were nose reshaping, eyelid surgery, liposuction, breast reduction, and facelift. Of the surgeries graphed, only two were more common among men than women: chin augmentation (52% for men) and hair transplantation (70% for men).<br /><br />Graph and quotes: <a href=""http://goo.gl/aoh7gU"" class=""ot-anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/aoh7gU</a>  <a class=""ot-hashtag"" href=""https://plus.google.com/s/%23melookprettyoneday"">#melookprettyoneday</a>  ",link,1378104443,40

And they absolutely 100% deserve their position. I love them. But.... it is imprecise to say that web sales for Macys and Best Buy and Staples and Wal-Mart &quot;remain small after decades of toil.&quot;<br /><br />Decades of toil for what? Except for Amazon most of these retailers simply stink at ecommerce. Have you been to the Macy&#39;s website recently? It looks like I walked into a K-Mart (and I don&#39;t pay the high prices when I walk into a Macy&#39;s store because they make me feel like K-Mart!).<br /><br />Amazon has won fair and square. But it has also benefited from the sheer incompetence of its competitors. Horrid return policies. Terrible customer service. Awful personalization. Disappointing shipping times. Complete lack of use of their offline presence power. Painfully bad Search / Display / Social / Email marketing strategies.

A lot fewer &quot;medium skill, well paying jobs&quot; and a lot more &quot;very high skill, high wage jobs&quot; and a lot more &quot;low skill, low wage jobs.&quot;<br /><br />Some of what explains this shift (we still have to give it some years to play out) is automation and efficiency. But it is mystifying that so many teacher&#39;s jobs have been lost. Don&#39;t we need someone to teach our children (so that they will be in the green area and not purple)?<br /><br />This of course has an implication on the great American middle class (and that in other countries).  It also has implications on what people who might not go to school and follow a college degree traditional path might have as options.

She is favoriting posts (causing people like me to find her!), she is retweeting other people&#39;s posts. Also a nice way to get attention. Kudos Ms. Cannon.<br /><br />This is a fantastic demonstration of the stupidity of Marketers. We want more followers, Likes, +1s, Circles, because we believe that is proof of our marketing power. That in turn fuels businesses like these who are only delighted to deliver your &quot;social proof,&quot; for $79. If we cared about what mattered, Amplification Rate, Applause Rate, Conversation Rate, Economic Value (<a href=""http://zqi.me/rocksocial"" class=""ot-anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zqi.me/rocksocial</a>), we will end up creating real social relationships that show real social proof. <br /><br />Am I optimistic that will happen?
